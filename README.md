# Computer-Network-Topologies-Design
This project demonstrates the design and configuration of multiple network topologies — Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh, and Extended Star — combined into a unified Hybrid Network Model using Cisco Packet Tracer. The hybrid setup integrates VLAN segmentation, DHCP for dynamic IP allocation, DNS for domain resolution, and both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing.
